# WTF is the Panama DAO?

Panama was on the verge of passing a very encompassing crypto Bill that was to put Panama on the Crypto map and put us on path to become a regional crypto hub, as well as regulatory clarity to regular citizens and crypto builders. Unfortunately, after the law was approved in Congress, the President vetoed it. 

Many of the Panama DAO's founders are authors of the Bill in mention.

Panama is now in crypto regulatory limbo again.

In come the Panama DAO, aiming to build Panama into a crypto republic from the ground up, instead of from the top down. We are big fans of Nouns and the decentralized nature of how it's built, and we think it's a great model to build a DAO for our country. 

Every day 1 NFT is minted. All auction proceeds go the the treasury. The treasury is used for funding public goods and proliferation of the DAO.

The NFTs are composed of traits inspired by Panamanian history and culture.

Our vision is to in time bootstrap enough funds into the treasury via the Nouns DAO flywheel effect in order to buy land, fund local development and build out the beginnings of a network state within the country.
