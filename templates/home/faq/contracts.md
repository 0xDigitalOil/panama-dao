All contracts are upgradable proxies, meaning the DAO can transition the implementation to a new contract by passing a proposal (via vote) that executes such a transaction.

Even the Metadata contract is mutable, meaning the DAO even has the ability to upgrade the NFT images themselves (e.g. adding new traits).
