Every day, forever, 1 Pitiguay is minted. All auction proceeds go straight to the DAO Treasury.

The Treasury is controlled 100% by Pitiguay owners in proportion to how many NFTs each owns.

Every 10th minted NFT (including NFT #0) is sent to Los Fundadores (losfundadores.eth). This 10% is a lifetime reward to the project founders.

Only for the near term Los Fundadores have veto power. Our intention is to relieve ourselves of this power at the latest when we reach 1,000 distinct NFT holders.

Note that veto power doesn't grant Los Fundadores the right to pass any proposal they want. It only allows vetoing an already passed proposal, and is to be applied to protect The Panama DAO Treasury from malicious proposals if they are able to slip through.
