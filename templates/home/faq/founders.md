title: How does founder allocation work?
order: 2

Founder allocations are a custom % of tokens over a custom period of time to specified wallet addresses. In Nouns DAO, this is 10% of/ tokens for 5 years (token 0, 10, 20 etc) for the DAO founders.

Founder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of auctions. Tokens are sent directly to the founderâ€™s wallets and auctions/ continue on schedule with the next available ID.
